# OpenNMS Velocloud Intergration Plugin [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OpenNMS/opennms-velocloud-plugin.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/OpenNMS/opennms-velocloud-plugin)


This plugin was generated by the OIA archetype and is used as example project layout.

The generated plugin contains code examples to demonstrate how to create a:
* Karaf Shell Command (see StatsCommand & TopologyCommand)
* REST Endpoint (see WebhookHandler & WebhookHandlerImpl)
* Event Configuration Extension (see EventConfExtension)
* Alarm Lifecycle Listener (see AlarmForwarder)



Build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:

```
mvn clean install
```


From the OpenNMS Karaf shell:
```
feature:repo-add mvn:org.opennms.plugins.velocloud/karaf-features/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/xml
feature:install opennms-plugins-velocloud
```


```
cp assembly/kar/target/opennms-velocloud-plugin.kar /opt/opennms/deploy/
feature:install opennms-plugins-velocloud
```

```
bundle:watch *
```


Once installed, the plugin makes the following Karaf shell commands available:
* opennms-velocloud:stats
* opennms-velocloud:push-topology

You can also access the REST endpoint mounted by the plugin at `http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/velocloud/ping`
